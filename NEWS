telepathy-haze 0.2.0 – "I Remember Piano Lessons" (2008-02-07)
==============================================================

 * Protocols now present the correct parameters, with appropriate
   defaults, rather than always taking account, password and server.
 * Send apostrophes correctly on Yahoo! Messenger.

telepathy-haze 0.1.4 – "Watch That Pinkie" (2007-11-21)
=======================================================

 * Fix building against glib 2.10 (which is the lowest version against
   which telepathy-glib builds).
 * Fix building against libpurple when built without D-Bus support, and
   suppress libpurple's own D-Bus messages on libpurple <= 2.1.0 (they
   were already suppressed on later libpurples).

telepathy-haze 0.1.3 – "Fix the Sky a Little" (2007-11-14)
==========================================================

 * Don't mistakenly delete ~/.purple on exit with libpurple >= 2.3.0
 * Build without warnings against telepathy-glib 0.6.1.
 * Disable -Werror in releases.
 * Report message send errors.
 * Report reasons for disconnecting properly (requires libpurple >= 2.3.0)

telepathy-haze 0.1.2 – "Re: Your Brains" (2007-09-16)
======================================================

 * Properly clean up zombie children.  No more mountains of defunct
   telepathy-haze processes!
 * Fix sending messages with <, > and &.  (Previously, "i <3 u" was sent as
   "i ", which is much less romantic.)
 * Use "local-xmpp" rather than "bonjour" as the name of the protocol
   formerly known as Rendezvous.

telepathy-haze 0.1.1 – "Release less often, release correctly" (2007-08-17)
===========================================================================

 * Fixed some segfaults, and some corruption caused by g_free-ing
   slice-allocated memory.
